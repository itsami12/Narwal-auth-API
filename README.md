# Narwhal Authentication API

The Narwhal Authentication API provides a streamlined and secure solution for user authentication, utilizing Node.js for server-side operations and JavaScript for client-side functionality. This project includes a secure API for password authentication using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), a demonstrative website, and a JavaScript library for client-side ZKP calculations.

## Objective

- **Secure Authentication**: Implement ZKP for secure password authentication.
- **Demonstrative Website**: Provide a web interface demonstrating the API's capabilities.
- **Client-Side ZKP Library**: Develop a library to handle ZKP calculations on the client side.

## Features

- **Node.js Server-side**: Leverage Node.js for scalable and efficient backend operations.
- **JavaScript Client-side**: Enhance the client-side experience with dynamic JavaScript functionalities.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store and manage user data securely with MongoDB.
- **Cryptographic Techniques**: Utilize advanced cryptographic methods to ensure secure authentication processes.
